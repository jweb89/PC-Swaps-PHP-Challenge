## Prompt:
Build a simple PHP project that verifies a phone number using the Twilio API. This should be a simple html form(styling does not matter AT ALL, basically just a phone-number input and a code input). This should include server-side validation that checks for a valid phone number and valid a code. You will need a way to store the phone number for the second request to verify the code. This can be done by leaving it in the html form or storing it locally in a variable, please do not use a database, that is beyond the scope of this project. 

The twilio verification API can be found at this link:https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api#base-url

To view the php codde simply navigate to the top right menu and choose the PHP option.

You will need to create a Twilio account and create API keys. Please do not upload your keys with the project. Do however include some explanation regarding how the get the project running and where to add our own API keys to test it. 

Once completed please send a github or similar link to support@pcswaps.com.

Happy coding!
